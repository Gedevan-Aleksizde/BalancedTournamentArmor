#Balanced Tournament Armor
This is a simple mod that is partly inspired by the now-defunct Tournament Fair Armour.

In the vanilla game, tournament participants wear the armor that they normally wear in battles.

This causes lords to be unbalanced due to their high weapon skills and high armor ratings.

Tournament participants will now all wear the tier 1 troop armor of the culture of the settlement the tournament is held in.

This mod requires Harmony.

It is safe to install and uninstall on an existing save.
